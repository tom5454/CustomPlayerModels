You can change your model on-the-fly with the models menu.
Export your model with the [Model option](https://github.com/tom5454/CustomPlayerModels/wiki/Exporting#model-file) 

The `Load from Skin` button (previously `Reset Skin`) removes the active `.cpmmodel` and loads your model from your [skin](https://github.com/tom5454/CustomPlayerModels/wiki/Exporting#stored-in-skin).

## Folders
The models menu support folders of models.  
You can place an `icon.png` and a `description.txt` to set the folder icon and description in the models menu.

## Importing
You can drag and drop `.cpmmodel` files into the Minecraft game window while the models menu is open to import them.

## Models Popup

> [!NOTE]

You can select a model and click `Upload Skin` to covert an existing `.cpmmodel` to a skin export.  
You must export your `.cpmmodel` with the Skin Compatible option for this to work.

Change Skin works replaces your skin with the selected one.
