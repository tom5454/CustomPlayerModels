This is a modified copy from [Markdown Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  
This contains all of the features that the CPM ingame wiki viewer supports. 

This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

## Emphasis

```no-highlight
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

```no-highlight
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers matter, this is different from the spec.
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## Links

There are two ways to create links.

```no-highlight
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

[The text itself] won't work.

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
```

## Images

All images must be uploaded into the wiki repo.  
Place your images into `Localization/wiki/images`, if you can please reuse existing images.  

```no-highlight
Here's a spinner (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style: 
![alt text](https://github.com/tom5454/CustomPlayerModels/wiki/images/spinner.png "Spinner Text 1")

Reference-style: 
![alt text][logo]

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's  -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer.

```no-highlight
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are fenced by lines with three back-ticks '\`\`\`'.

```
\```java
public static void test() {
	String s = "Java syntax highlighting, only on GitHub";
	System.out.println(s);
}
\```
 
\```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
\```
```


```java
public static void test() {
	String s = "Java syntax highlighting";
	System.out.println(s);
}
```

## Footnotes

Footnotes aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they [supported by GFM](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#footnotes).

```no-highlight
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

<a name="tables"/>

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and CPM Wiki Viewer supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

```no-highlight
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are required, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less | Pretty |
| --- | --- | ---
| *Still* | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
```

## Blockquotes

```no-highlight
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Line Breaks

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &lt;Enter&gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend. 

Here are some things to try out:

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
```

## YouTube Videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

```no-highlight
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://github.com/tom5454/CustomPlayerModels/wiki/images/spinner.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```

See [Images](#images) on how to load your custom image.
