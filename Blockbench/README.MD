# Customizable Player Models Blockbench Plugin  
**This plugin is in early-alpha, it only adds support for importing and exporting `.cpmproject` files.**  
Known issues/bugs:
- Scale doesn't get imported: Blockbench does not support this feature
- Tex. Scale: same as above, these parts won't display correctly in Blockbench either.
- Root part offsets and rotations doesn't get imported/exported.

If you find a bug report it here [Bugtracker](https://github.com/tom5454/CustomPlayerModels/issues) / Click on issues, and create an issue with screenshots and your blockbench project attached in a .zip file.
