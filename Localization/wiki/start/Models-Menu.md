You can change your model on-the-fly with the models menu.
Export your model with the [Model option](https://github.com/tom5454/CustomPlayerModels/wiki/Exporting#model-file) 

The `Load from Skin` button (previously `Reset Skin`) removes the active `.cpmmodel` and loads your model from your [skin](https://github.com/tom5454/CustomPlayerModels/wiki/Exporting#stored-in-skin).
