### Q: Discord?
A: [https://discord.gg/mKyXdEsMZD](https://discord.gg/mKyXdEsMZD)

### Q: Does the mod work in servers?
A: This is a client side mod. That means anyone with the mod can see your models. See: [Exporting](https://github.com/tom5454/CustomPlayerModels/wiki/Exporting)

### Q: Does this project/model work on my Minecraft version?
A: Yes, projects and models work across all supported Minecraft versions.

### Q: Where is the model editor?
A: On the top left of the screen. You do NOT need to download a third party program.

### Q: How do I make a model?
A: I would recommend starting with using the tool Convert Vanilla Parts which allows you to edit the limbs directly. Then add blocks, bits and textures until you are done.

A: See [#free-models on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/811508670205788211/811532237521551360).

### Q: How do I color or texture?
A: Look on the left hand panel and use that to change it. But it is alot easier if you do it on a third party software like paint.net, gimp or photoshop. You can also change the size of the texture sheet.

### Q: How do you make more shapes?
A: You can't unless you use cubes to make it. You can make a triangle with two squares with the same color etc. 

### Q: How do I animate?
A: Move it pose to pose and use the ms count to make it how long the animation lasts. You can make parts appear and disappear in animations!

### Q: How do I export?
A: Press the export button, select a skin that the vanilla players will see. Choose the export location and a name for the file, and if a file has the same name or has a invalid character it will not export.

### Q :What is a gist?
A: [https://gist.github.com/](https://gist.github.com/) to create it Yes you will need to make an account, and the program will give you something to copy and paste into the gist. After you create the gist copy the link to it and paste it in the editor. You need this because the skin file cannot contain it because there is too much data for it to store on the skin.

### Q:Are there any tutorials?
A: See [#community-tutorials on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/811508670205788211/844561618281168968) or [Comprehensive CPM User Guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/117GBWxtyNT6L3a69cENXz1Gjx-MplB1UC9l_uISn6oQ/edit?usp=sharing) (Google Docs) by `@w3eb on Discord` for more info.  
 
### Q: How do I make a part glow?
A: Using one of the effects called "glowing eyes" you can make a whole part/block "glow" (enderman eyes). Also it will be transparent, to fix that create two of the same part in the exact same position and only make ONE OF THEM glow! Then it will be a solid "glowing" parts! (You can make it actually glow using shaders)

### Q: How do I stop using the vanilla animations?
A: Turn off additive, then move the root limbs just a little bit and then you can make your own animations! (**Not the things inside from when you convert vanilla parts**). Or Use the disable vanilla animations effect.

### Q: It's not showing up in game!
A: Are you sure you are using the right skin? Check to see if there is data on the skin (bits of color and stuff).
Offline/pirate servers don't load skins, so test in single player first.

### Q: Can someone make me a model
A: Unless someone offers to NEVER ASK FOR FREE WORK UNLESS THEY WANT TO DO IT!!!

### Q: How to make fancy legs?
A: Arrange the cubes in a certain way to make special legs, a common one that many people make is bipedal legs.

A: Add a bunch of cubes and make it long, There are videos on YouTube.
